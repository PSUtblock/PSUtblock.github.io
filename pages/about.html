                <h1>About Me:</h1>
                <p>
                Hello, My name is Travis Block and I am currently a student studying at Portland State Univeristy. I have a wide
                variety of interests and hobbies, and often struggle to find which to fully commit to. I have a passion for education and
                whatever I can do to connect students with the content they are learning is pivotal for me. So, as I think towards the future of
                education, the use of technology grows more and more. Because of this, I study computer science to bolster my love of education and
                merge the two disciplines together to make many learning tools and interactions from students. From flashcards to small educational
                games, or to just a well designed site, I would like to create them all to ensure someone can learn from my creations. 
                </p>
                <p>
                I have only recently began this journey and I hope that in the coming months or years, I will have something  to show for it.
                At this moment I have only a few examples of what I have been working on, but admitidly more archiving and storing my projects on
                github is needed, but thankfully I am getting the hang of that!
                </p>
                <p>
                Currently, I am working as a technology and training consultant in Portland Oregon, and much of my time is spent documenting procedures on various
                software and other technical tasks. However, recently I have been working a customer service portal for customers to submit maintenance requests through.
                It is a bit of change in pace from my normal tasks, which is why continuing my education is pivotal to keep adapting to my work tasks. I do not
                believe I will do this forever, but I certainly enjoy it now.
                </p>
                <p>
                My dream goal is to be in a position that allows me to work with other instructors and develop curriculums with digital integration and curate
                thoughtful content for students to understand concepts. I am a firm believer that the environment plays a role in someones attainment of knowledge, and
                see the digital realm as a space that can be neutral and offer many learning styles at the convienience to those wanting to learn. While I do not have This
                position now, I do enjoy creating things in my free time that would reflect what I want to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am sure that I will update this site every so often, so feel free to bookmark it if what little content here already interests you.
