      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p>
        I am Travis Block, a computer science student at Portland State
        University. This is my portfolio site that shares information about me
        and some of the projects I am currently working on. I do not have much
        content but I hope that in the next few years I will have many more
        examples to share.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Future Goals as of November 2021:</h2>
      <br />
      <h3>Expanding on My Educational Content</h3>
      <p>
        A lot of my web development journey comes from my desires to tap more
        into my ability of creating educational content. In my past I have been
        an Instructional Designer and I have made quite a few trainings using
        Adobe Captivate. Captivate is some pretty cool software and is built off
        javascript, html, and other web focused tools. Additionaly, the
        softwares interface is akin to that of PowerPoint, but with it's
        simplicities came barriers that did not really allow me to be efficient
        and speedy with my development. So I started looking more at the core of
        the product to see what I could really do ungoverned by software
        limitations. To say it has been a lot to take in is putting it lightly,
        but I am confident that I will be able to accomplish what I would like
        to do in more effective ways once I get the hang of everything.
      </p>

      <h3>Pushing my Animation</h3>
      <p>
        I am very new to web development, but I think it is an amazing way to
        convey a message and share your style. I have been into animation for a
        long time, but never really challenged myself to create my own. So, what
        better platform to start? Thanks to my class project, I have developed
        this site, and now I can use it as a playground to try new things. In
        particular Animation! Aside from that, I am an educator, so I am hoping
        to use everything I have learned to develop interesting learning content
        that is accessible through the power of the world wide web!
