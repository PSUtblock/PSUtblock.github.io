If you have taken an online training it was probably made with Captivate. This is a flashcard project I made. I pushed Captivate to the limits of what it coudld do, and ultimately while I found my path to my solution, it is a very tedious one. That process is what inspired me to take a web development class, because I believe I can find a better way with the knowledge."
