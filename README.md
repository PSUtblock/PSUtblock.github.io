## Resources Beyond css,javascript,html
The only aspect that you would have to consider importing is the source for Lottie files to handle the animations. All of the documentation can be found at:

https://lottiefiles.com

## How to Use
Like many other elements, once you have imported the source file for Lotties you can begin adding the <lottie> element to start building. 

It works similarly to how you would use an <img> element, but there are just different features that the lottie element provides.
